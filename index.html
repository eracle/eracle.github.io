                    I have worked as a consultant since 2016 in different roles: Machine Learning Engineer, Data
                    Architect, Data Scientist, DevOps, and Scrum Master. I have worked on all aspects of data
                    management: retrieval, storage, cloud infrastructure scaling, statistical analysis and data mining.
                    Following the entire data life-cycle: web scraping, design of relational databases, cloud
                    deployment, RESTful API and Jupyter Notebooks. In 2019 I took a couple of sabbatical years to
                    investigate Statistics & Finance. I also contributed to two scientific papers on Web Scraping and
                    Data Visualization.

                <p>Is a website that embodies my philosophy of working smarter, not harder. The website
                    was developed with the goal of helping users make informed purchasing decisions while reducing
                    the time and effort they spend researching products.The website uses advanced Natural Language

                    presented in the form of <a href="https://where2buy.it">detailed product reviews</a>.
                    By automating the research process, where2buy.it allows users to spend less time researching
                    products and more time enjoying the things they love. It's a perfect example of how technology

                    In 2020, I had time to experiment and study new technologies. I had some savings but
                    no idea where to invest.
                    I started writing code using some open-source libraries to perform time series forecasting using
                    Bayesian models. The algorithm was able to identify the most interesting Exchange Traded Funds
                    on the
                    market. From that, I refined it by making it create a balanced portfolio with minimum variance.
                    I couldn't keep the algorithm secret on my hard disk, so I made a platform on top of that. Now,
                    everybody can download the most promising ETF and autonomously invest. For free.

                    The book was Financial Machine Learning by De Prado, and that post took an unexpected and
                    unmotivated amount of attention. I concluded that the book's topic was of high interest among my
                    professional circle composed by software developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time, I decided to open a blog called Creative Quant, initially containing the output
                    of an experiment I made using real data. It was an interesting experience, but I am not sure
                    that the technical writer is going to be my career path. At least, it was an opportunity to
                    perform validated learning.

                    During the first lockdown, I took some time off to contribute to an open-source project: Dask.
                    It was an intriguing and challenging mental activity, design and implement a new feature in a
                    library used to perform distributed scientific computing.

                <p>
                    The feature I implemented is random sampling on Distributed Sets (Bags). Implementing it allowed
                    me to face the main challenges the Big data sector has to deal with daily.

                    Regarding the location, Palermo is a place that I use to call the Italian Canary Islands because
                    of its perpetual good climate and excellent high quality of living.
